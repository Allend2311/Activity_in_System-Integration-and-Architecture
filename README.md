**ACTVITY IN System Integration and Architecture**

There is always a certain excitement and intrigue that comes when beginning a new subject! I look to be challenged in new ways that will enhance my skills, grow my knowledge base and overall experience with the subject! Because each subject will focus on its own lessons, I want to approach each lesson with an open frame of mind and a sense of being willing to make mistakes as I go along.

I also expect this subject will hopefully also help me grow to have higher achievement related study skills and discipline. I know that the lessons themselves will require regular practice, application and dedication it may require my organize my workspace, utilize time wisely, while presenting my best work. Further, I assume we will have a mix of activities, discussions, and the odd project, that will result in a more meaningful and engaging learning experience; in turn hopefully enhancing both my critical thinking and problem solving skills!

Education is most valuable and meaningful when it is extended beyond the classroom setting. Throughout this subject, I hope to learn to think of things in new ways and understand its implications in everyday life. Overall, I look forward to learning, growing as a student and ultimately getting everything I can out of this subject.
